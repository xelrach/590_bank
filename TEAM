Milestone #1:

Charles (noneman):  I designed the message protocol. Built the original process starting script (since removed). Handled merging everyone's code. Wrote the make file.

Zach (zdexter):  Created topology class that starts the system up and reads in the topology and constructs the various nodes.  Wrote TOPO, TEAM and README files.

Hui (hguo):  I wrote the ATM GUI with Swing on NetBeans IDE 6.9.1 platform. The GUI
takes orders for users and sends the messages to its responsible server.  Only datagram client was implemented in GUI, so GUI always sends out
messages.

Pete (pstein): I added the branch server class, with the logic for handling requests from the GUI and transfers from other branches.


Milestone #2:
Charles (noneman): Wrote the snapshot code. Rewrite of transfer code. Fixed lots of bugs.

Zach (zdexter):  GUI_Server_Process and associated code for ATMGUI (the GUI Server) and updated code for topology.  README and test.py test script.  Fixed lots of snapshot handling bugs.

Hui (hguo): Added snapshot button and text area to show snap answer. Added server thread to GUI.

Pete (pstein): Broke the branches into seperate processes. Wrote marker messages.
