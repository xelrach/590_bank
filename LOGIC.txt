******** Quantification of timing and delay procedures ********


******** Primary/backup method description ********


******** Recovery protocol description ********
Recovery is done by state transfer. When a process wakes up from its fake crash, it asks one of the other processes for the current master server. The recovering process asks the master server for its state. The master server queues incoming messages while it gathers its state and sends it to the recovering process. The recovering process then sets all of its accounts to their current values and is then ready to receive messages as a normal backup. 

******** Failure Detection Description:  Heartbeat ********

We use a heartbeat method to detect failure:
	- Every second, each node that thinks it's the master node in its cluster sends out a heartbeat message to all the other nodes its knows are in the cluster
	- Every second, all nodes that think they are *not* masters in their clusters:
		- Set a flag master_is_alive = false
		- Heartbeat check:  If a heartbeat is received by the end of that second, master_is_alive becomes true
		- If master_is_alive == false at the second of the second, after the heartbeat check, node infers failure of the master
			- At this point, node initiates recovery process
				- Starts by initiating selection of new master
