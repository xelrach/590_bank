How to use this system:

1) Insert desired branch-link input into TOPO file like so:
01 02
05 01
.. meaning that branch 01 can communicate with branch 02, and branch 05 can communicate with branch 01
	
2) Click the FAIL button on the top-right of any of the branch GUIs
	- This will cause the branch to go offline for a random time period in [15sec,2min]
	- Wait for the amount of time specified in the console output
	- After this time, the branch will come back online
