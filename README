How to use this system:

1) Insert desired branch-link input into TOPO file like so:
01 02
05 01
.. meaning that branch 01 can communicate with branch 02, and branch 05 can communicate with branch 01

2) python test.py (if you rename the topology file to something besides topo, use--topology=TOPO_NEW_FILE_NAME)
	- this script will run ./make for you
	- then the script will start up branch servers and GUIs by running java topology <TOPO_FILE_NAME>
